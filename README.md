## Task 1: Convert PSD to HTML

Convert this simple twitter search UI into HTML and CSS (Just use placeholder data for now). 
Don't sweat too much on the chrome of the app but pay attention to the layout and the typographical 
elements of the app. If you fancy it, then you could also drop in a simple media query to make this 
mobile friendly too.

If time is of a concern then focus more on quality than fidelity.

## Task 2: Refactor some appalling JS

**Disclaimer:** *We whole heartedly acknowledge that putting this app on a framework is superfluous to its needs but it is in the interest of your time that we have kept it simple.*

We want you to refactor this JavaScript into a Backbone.js application using the HTML and CSS you built for 
Task 1. You do not need to extend the functionality at all, just seperate out the concerns into an application.
